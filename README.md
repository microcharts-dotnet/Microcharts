**Microcharts** is an extremely simple charting library for a wide range of platforms (see *Compatibility* section below), with shared code and rendering for all of them!

read our [wiki](https://github.com/dotnet-ad/Microcharts/wiki) to learn more about how to use this library.

## About

This project is just simple drawing on top of the awesome [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) library. The purpose is not to have an heavily customizable charting library. If you want so, simply fork the code, since all of this is fairly simple. Their is no interaction, nor animation at the moment.
